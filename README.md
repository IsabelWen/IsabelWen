### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm passionate about coding since my Bachelor's in business administration at the Free University of Berlin, where I gained initial experiences with programming languages such as Python, R, PHP, and SQL.
To make my coding passion my profession, I completed Career Foundry's Full-Stack Web Developer program, learning JavaScript, React, TypeScript and more.
